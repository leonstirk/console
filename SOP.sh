LETTER ADDRESSING STUFF

\textbf{Regarding Sale of Property: ADDRESS}

WE have been advised that a sale has been confirmed and will take place on DATE. The new owners should contact you to advise a change of bank account for the rent and who to contact in the case of maintenance etc following the sale.

In the mean time you should continue to pay the rent to us and contact us if yo have any queries. As rent is paid in advance, ther is likely to be rent paid to us which relates to some period after the sale. Rest assured the solicitors work out the rent allocation and that is transferred to the new owners along with the original of your tenancy agreement, keys and a change of landlord form to enable the bond to be signed for at the end of your tenancy.

We have attached your rent summary showing the remaining payments due to us prior to the sale.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your assistance during the sale period and to let you know that it has been a pleasure dealing with you during the time you have rented through us.

If you have any queries or if we can be of any assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Regards

Leon Stirk-Wang
Property Manager
