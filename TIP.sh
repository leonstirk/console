\section*{Tenancy Information Pack}                               

This information pack contains important information about your tenancy. Please retain it and keep it in a safe place.
                                                                     
\subsection*{About Us}

Welcome to your new rental property. We hope that you will enjoy living here and that your experience dealing with Ascroft Property Management will be like it is for most of our tenants – an enjoyable experience. 
Our role as Property Manager for this property can be summarised as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item To ensure that the property is well looked after.
\item To ensure that you (the tenant/s) are the right tenant/s for the property and that you will look after the property.
\item To ensure that rent payments are paid and collected in a timely manner on behalf of the landlord.
\item To ensure that we comply with all legislation relating to residential tenancies.
\item To ensure maintenance issues raised by the landlord and tenants are dealt with in a timely fashion.
\end{itemize}

In order to perform our role professionally we all have specific roles within Ascroft Property Management. We endevour to maintain a single point of contact for our tenants to ensure the highest quality communication and care but it does mean that on occasion you may deal with someone else. 

That said, Leon will be your first point of contact and is the property manager for your property. If you have queries regarding your rent payments or any other property management matters, please get in touch with Leon. The quickest way to get hold of him is by email at info@asroftproperty.co.nz or by phone on 021 034 2105. Leon is often out and about during the day at various rentals, therefore the quickest and easiest way to contact him is via text or email.
Ascroft Property Management use a wide range of contractors to maintain our landlords’ rentals. They will always make contact with you before entering your property.

\subsection*{Rent Payments}

Unless you have come to some other arrangement you will pay your rent to us on a fort-nightly basis-in advance. You will have paid your first two weeks rent before you moved into the property. Your next rent payment MUST be made before the end of your 2nd week in the tenancy. Failure to make your next (or any future rent payments on time) will register as an ‘arrears’ in our computerised system. We treat rental arrears very seriously and we will notify you immediately when a payment is not received. Failure to rectify rental arrears in a timely manner may result in us writing to you formally which is the commencement of formal Tenancy Tribunal action. 

\paragraph{How can I ensure that my rent payments are always made on time?}\\

The answer is this is simple – set up an automatic payment from your bank account to our bank account for the exact amount of your rent. The details of our bank account are on the first page of your tenancy agreement. Just in case you have missed it here it is again. Ascroft Property 06-0942-0676557-01. Always use your surname plus the address of the property as the reference. 

\subsection*{Utilities and other important information}

\subsubsection*{Power/electricity}

Is it your responsibility to choose a power supplier and to arrange to have the electricity supply to the property registered in your name. We strongly suggest you consider Powershop (www.powershop.co.nz). Please let us know if you would like us to send you a link which will save you $50. A meter reading (taken during the entry inspection) will be recorded on your tenancy agreement.

\subsubsection*{Gas}

Gas hot water systems and stoves are generally fueled by LPG bottles housed on the exterior of the property.

There are several gas suppliers in the Dunedin area so it may pay to shop around.

Nova Energy 0800 668 236

Contact Energy 0800 80 9000

\subsubsection*{Water}

The Dunedin City Council provide the water supply and treatment throughout the city. These are included in the rates charged by the council and most tenants are not required to pay these.

\subsubsection*{Internet}

The kind of internet connection available will depend on where you are living. Many parts of Dunedin will have access to a gigabit fibre connection although there are still parts that will only have access to VDSL and ADSL connections.  The major players are Spark, Vodafone, and Orcon. Some of the smaller providers are now able to offer a good service. We suggest you shop around.

\subsubsection*{Rubbish}

Some tenant agreements will have the rubbish collection day identified on the tenancy agreement. Alternatively, it is easy to search the collect day for your address via Dunedin Council Website. Black prepaid rubbish bags are for household rubbish and are collected weekly. Yellow top bins are for paper and plastic recycling and are collected fortnightly alternating collection weeks with the blue glass recycling bins. Waste Management and EnviroWaste also offer private wheelie bin pickup services.

\subsubsection*{Mail}

You may receive mail at the property for previous occupants. We suggest that you write “no longer at this address - return to sender” on the outside of the envelope and place it in a mail box. 

\section*{Maintenance}

Generally, we become aware of maintenance issues at a property when you advise us of an issue you have noticed. Sometimes though, we also become aware of a maintenance issue requiring attention as a result of a routine inspection being carried out. When you become aware of a maintenance issue which you wish to bring to our attention we ask that you email us on: info@ascroftproperty.co.nz

It is very important that you don’t send us maintenance issues by way of text or as a general telephone call as this does not provide an adequate record of your request. 

In the case of an emergency (e.g. burst pipe inside house, exposed electrical wire etc.) please ring Leon directly on 021 034 2105 and advise that you have an emergency maintenance issue. This phone is monitored 24 hours per day. In the unlikely event that the operator is unable to contact one of us after hours and the issue is clearly an emergency which cannot be left please look up the yellow pages for an alternative. Contractors are only to be contacted in this situation if it is a true emergency requiring immediate attention. 

Wherever possible we will acknowledge a maintenance request but please keep in mind with most non-urgent maintenance issues we just need to obtain authority from the property owner before authorising the work. This can sometimes cause a small delay. 

\paragraph{How does the process work where a maintenance issue has been reported?}\\

On receipt of an email advising us of a maintenance issue our first task is to ensure that it is not ‘user error’. In some cases we may contact you to confirm the fault. We do this because if we send a contractor out for a maintenance issue which turns out to be user error we have no choice but to send the invoice to you for payment. Please don’t be offended if we question you about your maintenance issue. We log the maintenance report into our computerised system and create a works order which is sent to the appropriate contractor. The works order contains details of the property, the maintenance issue requiring attention and the contact details (provided to us by you) of each tenant recorded on the tenancy agreement. Once the works order has been emailed out it is the contractor’s responsibility to make contact with you in order to arrange access to the property. When a contractor makes contact with you please reply and discuss with him your preference for being present when he visits or advise that you are happy for him to use our keys. If the contractor does not receive a reply from any of the tenants at the property instructions on the works order advise that he should text/leave a message giving a minimum of 48 hours notice (Residential Tenancies Act) advising of a date and time when he will enter the property using our keys to investigate the maintenance issue. 

Note:  We are able to enter the premises inside the 48 hour notice period if the repair is considered urgent.  

\paragraph{Is all maintenance the responsibility of Ascroft Property?}\\

The simple answer to this is no. Common maintenance that you need to be responsible for includes: 

Cleaning heat pump filters. We suggest you do this monthly in the winter as it will make the heat pump more efficient and save you power. 

Light bulbs and smoke alarms, if a light bulb blows you are responsible for changing it (unless it is a specified bulb or access is difficult –e.g. it’s very high). Please use reasonable quality bulbs as some of the cheaper ones available now do not last long! Battery operated smoke alarms will give off an intermittent ‘beep’ when the battery gets low. This means it’s time for you to replace the battery.    Do not remove the smoke alarm from its bracket for any length of time as this means the alarm will operate. 

Keep drains free from objects and material which could cause them to block. Tenants with long hair need to pay particular attention to shower drains. 

\subsubsection*{Grounds maintenance}

Generally it is your responsibility to look after the lawns and gardens. We can arrange to have this done on your behalf if you wish – just let us know and we’ll give you a monthly price. You are not responsible for trimming large hedges or pruning trees, this is the landlord’s responsibility.

\subsection*{Inspections}

\subsubsection*{Entry and exit inspections}

We take detailed photographs and video at the time of the entry inspection. You will receive by email a copy of the ‘agreed condition’ page of your tenancy agreement within a few days of it being completed. We suggest that you keep it for your records. We keep the video footage and entry photographs on record until you have vacated the property at the end of the tenancy and the bond has been refunded to you or any outstanding matters finalised.

\subsubsection*{Routine Inspections}

The first ‘routine’ inspection will take place approximately one month after you move into the property. All of our routine condition reports are made on an IPad which has the facility to take and record photographs. Because these reports are forwarded on to the property owner general photographs showing the condition of the property will be taken and forwarded along with the report. We ask that you ensure that the property is clean and tidy inside and out for all inspections. 

\paragraph{How will I be notified of an upcoming routine inspection?}\\

You will receive a text message or email from us advising of the date and time period when the inspection will take place. Provided the date and time suits please reply to us. 

If you are not home at the time of the inspection we will use our keys to access the property. Due to the number of routine inspections we carry out it is often very hard to change the date and time so wherever possible please try to fit in with the date and time. 

If you are not home when the inspection takes place a note will be left advising:

\begin{itemize}
\item Date and time the inspection was carried out
\item The name of the person who completed the inspection
\item The condition we found the property in
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What happens if a routine inspection finds the property is not satisfactory?}\\

You will be advised in writing at the time of the inspection if the person carrying out the inspection is not satisfied. In serious cases we will follow up in an email advising of where and how we expect improvements in the condition of the properly. At the same time, we will advise of a follow up inspection (usually within 10 working days). If there has been no or little improvement in the condition of the property, we will serve a 14 day letter on you outlining what action we expect you to take. This is the commencement of Tenancy Tribunal action. Failure to follow the guidelines in the letter will result in us applying to terminate your tenancy which may affect your bond refund.

\subsection*{Tenancy agreements and bonds}

\subsubsection*{Fixed term tenancies}

Chances are you are in a fixed term tenancy. Fixed term tenancies are a legally binding contract for a specific length of time and cannot be ended by notice during the term of the tenancy. Depending on your tenancy we will contact you between 21 and 90 days before the date the tenancy expires in order to ascertain your intentions. We may agree to enter into a new tenancy agreement, or extend the existing tenancy agreement.

\paragraph{My circumstances have changed. How can I get out of this tenancy?}\\

Ascroft Property Management has a lease re-assignment process in these situations. It is not available to all of our tenancies and is considered on a case by case basis. Where we have agreed to a lease re-assignment you will be sent a form to sign. This form also outlines the fee. We will not be able to action your request until we have received the signed form and fee. We will then undertake to find a suitable tenant to take over your lease. Note that you will remain responsible for all aspects of the lease (including the likes of rent and garden maintenance) until a satisfactory tenant has been found to replace you. 

\paragraph{Your bond and how to ensure you receive a full refund:}\\

Your bond (equivalent to four weeks rent) will have been paid by us to the Department of Building and Housing. We will not authorise the release of the bond until we are satisfied that the property is being returned to us in the same condition (except for acceptable wear and tear) as it was at the start of the tenancy. We will expect any repairs to be carried out and paid for before the bond is refunded. Please note that if the property is not returned in an acceptable condition on the day that your tenancy ends (even although you may have moved out) you may be responsible for rent “lost” due to the fact that the property is not available for rent.

\paragraph{What should I do to ensure that the final inspection doesn’t hold up the return of the bond?}\\

Here’s a list of suggestions we have put together:

\begin{itemize}
\item All keys to be returned on the day the tenancy ends, if all the keys you were provided at the beginning of the tenancy cannot be accounted for you may be liable for locksmith charges. 
\item Any damage to the property must be attended to and put right before the end of the tenancy. 
\item All light bulbs must be going and light shades cleaned. 
\item All rooms are to be vacuumed and dusted, if professional carpet cleaning was a condition of your tenancy please ensure this is done and the carpets are dry at the end of the tenancy (we suggest using Chem-Dry Otago). 
\item Any mould on the ceilings (particularly in the bathroom) is to be wiped off using appropriate cleaner. 
\item Skirtings and windows ledges are to be wiped clean. 
\item Any marks on walls are to be wiped off. 
\item Heat pump filters and air fins are to be cleaned. 
\item Log burners and open fires to be cleaned out. 
\item The toilet and shower are to be thoroughly cleaned. Pay particular attention to shampoo and soap residue in the shower. An old toothbrush is good for cleaning door tracks and tight corners in the shower. 
\item All sinks and chrome facets in the kitchen and bathroom are to be wiped clean. 
\item All cupboards, drawers and benches are to be thoroughly cleaned and wiped out. 
\item Ovens and microwaves are to be cleaned inside and out. Ensure the oven racks are cleaned as well as oven trays. Remember to clean the warming drawer if there is one. 
\item  The rangehood is to be cleaned and the filters cleaned (put them through the dishwasher if they fit). 
\item Fridge freezer to be emptied of all food and food scraps and wiped out. Turn them off and leave the doors slightly open. 
\item Any broken crockery or glasses are to be replaced. 
\item The dryer filter and washing machine are to be cleaned. Detergent residue is to be cleaned from the washing machine. If there is a vacuum cleaner at the property empty it once cleaning is finished. 
\item All rubbish is to be removed from the premises and recycle bins are to be empty and left behind at the property. 
\item Lawns and gardens are to be tidied to the standard they were when you moved into the property. 
\item Contact your power company and give them the final meter reading. Advise them that a new tenant will be moving into the property to ensure that the power is not disconnected. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Contents insurance}

Sometimes damage to the property is unavoidable. We can never guarantee that the property owner has an appropriate level of insurance in place to cover accidental damage you may cause. We strongly suggest that you take out contents insurance cover to ensure that you will be covered should the property owner or his/her insurance company seek compensation for damage you have caused.  

\paragraph{What would be an example of where I might be financially liable accidental damage?}\\

A good example of this (and one we have experienced on more than one occasions!) is where a tenant mistakenly places a hot pot on top of a Formica bench. If left for even a short time, the pot will burn the top laminate of the bench causing it to bubble. Generally, this is impossible to repair and a new bench is required. Fitting a new bench top is costly in itself and often involves disconnecting plumbing etc. In such a case if the property owner’s insurance does not cover the damage you may be liable for the whole repair or for the insurance excess the property owner has to pay.
